# Saturday Coding Repository

Welcome to the Saturday Coding repository! This repository serves as a personal study project where I explore various programming concepts, technologies, and tools based on my curiosity and interests. It contains a collection of diverse code implementations for hands-on practice and experimentation.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a space for me to enhance my programming skills through practical projects. Each class or code snippet focuses on a specific topic, allowing me to delve into different areas of interest and explore various programming techniques.

## Classes and Implementations

| Class                      | Summary                                            | Technologies/Tools         |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| EventRegistrationBot       | An event registration bot for highly contested events. | Java, Selenium, Jsoup      |
| [Future Class 3]           | [Summary of Class 3]                               | [Technologies/Tools used]  |

Please note that the table above represents the current and future classes and implementations planned for this repository. As the repository evolves, new classes and code snippets will be added, each with its own purpose, summary, and the technologies and tools involved in their implementation.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. Happy coding!
